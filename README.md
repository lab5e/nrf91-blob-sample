# nRF9160 blob upload sample

This is an example of blob uploads with nRF9160.

Register the device in Span as you'd normally do, then build and launch the sample. The blob with auto-generated data is uploaded to Span.

This example is based on the Nordic nRF Connect sample `https_client` (but obviously without the TLS parts).
